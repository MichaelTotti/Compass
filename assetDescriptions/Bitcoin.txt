Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central authority, such as a government or financial institution. It was created in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and allows peer-to-peer transactions over a secure blockchain network. Bitcoin is often referred to as a cryptocurrency because it uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Its value can be highly volatile, and it is widely used both as an investment asset and for transferring value globally.
