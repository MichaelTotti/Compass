Solana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. It uses a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism combined with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to achieve high scalability, making it ideal for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Solana has gained popularity for its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second while maintaining decentralization and security.
