Cardano is a blockchain platform focused on providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Cardano uses a unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which aims to offer more energy-efficient and scalable solutions compared to traditional proof-of-work systems. The platform emphasizes peer-reviewed research and formal methods in its development, aiming for high security and sustainability in blockchain technology. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for staking and governance within the network.
