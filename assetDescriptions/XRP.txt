XRP is a cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs that focuses on fast, low-cost cross-border payments and remittances. Unlike traditional blockchain mining, XRP transactions are validated through a consensus protocol, making them more efficient and scalable. XRP is widely used by financial institutions for real-time settlements, but it has faced legal challenges regarding its classification as a security.
