Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke in 2013 but quickly gained popularity due to its fun, meme-inspired branding featuring the Shiba Inu dog. It operates on a decentralized blockchain, similar to Bitcoin, with fast and low-cost transactions. Dogecoin has a strong online community and has been used for tipping, donations, and even crowdfunding initiatives.
