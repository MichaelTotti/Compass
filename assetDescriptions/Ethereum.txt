Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced programmability to blockchain, allowing developers to build various applications, including DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs. Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with Ethereum 2.0, improving scalability and energy efficiency. It remains one of the most widely used and influential blockchains in the crypto space.
